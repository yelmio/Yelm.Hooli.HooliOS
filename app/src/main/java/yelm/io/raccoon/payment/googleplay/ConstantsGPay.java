    // remove this static block and run the sample.
    // Before you start, please take a look at PaymentsUtil.java to see where the constants are used
    // and to potentially remove ones not relevant to your integration.
    // Required changes:
    // 1.  Update SUPPORTED_NETWORKS and SUPPORTED_METHODS if required (consult your processor if
    //     unsure).
    // 2.  Update CURRENCY_CODE to the currency you use.
    // 3.  Update SHIPPING_SUPPORTED_COUNTRIES to list the countries where you currently ship. If
    //     this is not applicable to your app, remove the relevant bits from PaymentsUtil.java.
    // 4.  If you're integrating with your processor / gateway directly, update
    //     GATEWAY_TOKENIZATION_NAME and GATEWAY_TOKENIZATION_PARAMETERS per the instructions they
    //     provided. You don't need to update DIRECT_TOKENIZATION_PUBLIC_KEY.
    // 5.  If you're using direct integration, please consult the documentation to learn about
    //     next steps.
